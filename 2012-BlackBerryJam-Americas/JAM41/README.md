_Abstract_: This lab will help guide you through the fundamental concepts of developing a BlackBerry® WebWorks™ application, with a focus on some of the latest BlackBerry® 10 concepts and APIs delivered in our latest release. We will demostrate the environment setup process, then jump right in to packaging, signing, and deploying your first application. From there we will dive into enhancing a sample WebWorks application with some high value APIs delivering fundamental BlackBerry 10 user experience concepts such as invocation, cards, PIM, and more.
