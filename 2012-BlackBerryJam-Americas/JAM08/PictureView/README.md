PictureView is a small app showing how to set up a multi-tabbed Cascades project that allows the user to leverage the camera for taking pictures and 
then view the taken pictures.  It is designed for illustrating Cascades functionality and how to use Cascades controls such as buttons and drowndowns
as well as incorporate custom controls such as camera and viewers.  It also illustrates how to use invocations.

Built for the intro to NDK session at BBJam in Sept 2012.   If you update or modify this example, please update the running version info as well.
