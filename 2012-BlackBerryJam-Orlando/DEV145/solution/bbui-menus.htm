		<p>		
			The bbUI toolkit builds the application's UI in the most optimized fashion for the target operating system.  It follows a methodology of a single web page that has screens loaded into it as HTML fragments: each screen is its own HTML fragment file. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The toolkit then uses AJAX to **push** and **pop** screens off of the stack.  The toolkilt manages the screen stack and loading the content.  This ensures the best use of device memory.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also define screen loading transition effects. Currently the fade effect is supported.
		</p>
		
		<b> Tasks: </b>
		<ol>
			<li>Edit bbui-screens.htm</li>
			<li>Add onclick="bb.pushScreen('bbui-newscreen.htm', 'newscreen');" to the &lt;button&gt; </li>
			<li>Test using Ripple, click on the "open new screen" button and verify that "New Screen" is opened</li>
			<li>Click the back button.  Verify "New Screen" is popped off display stack and return to bbui-screens.htm.</li>
			<li>Edit bbui-newscreen.htm</li>
			<li>Add data-bb-effect="fade" to the &lt;div data-bb-type="screen"&gt; element</li>
			<li>Test using Ripple, click on the "open new screen" button and verify that "New Screen" is opened with a fade effect.</li>
		</ol>

				Tips:
