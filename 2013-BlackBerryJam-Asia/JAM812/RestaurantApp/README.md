Material from Session: JAM812 - Build an App in 60 Minutes with Cascades

Presenters: Anthony Hu and David Clayworth

Abstract: The Cascades™ toolkit lets you develop clean, performant applications
that integrate seamlessly with the BlackBerry® look and feel. It is also designed
to maximize your productivity, making app creation easier than it has ever been before.
In a single session we will show you how you can code a full-functional native
BlackBerry app using the Cascades toolkit. Taking existing data, we will generate
a user interface from scratch using QML, integrating it with the BlackBerry platform
and making it ready for publication and Built for BlackBerry certification.
This session will touch on tools and techniques needed to develop for Cascades,
but is not intended as an introduction to Cascades development.
This sample is part of the material for the session.
