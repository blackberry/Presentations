Material from Session: JAM837 - Localization: Developing Apps for the International Customer

Presenters: Mohammad El-Kadri, Anthony Hu

Abstract: With BlackBerry gaining ground in international markets and with the device available in over 30 languages, the market is more than ripe for developers to focus on localizing their applications so that they can appeal to the international customer. Besides having the app translated into different languages, there are certain considerations that need to be taken into place while the application is being developed to ensure that it can integrate well to translations and markets requiring specific layouts. This session will provide an overview of such practices followed by questions and answers from developers looking to expand their customer base internationally.  This sample is part of the session.
