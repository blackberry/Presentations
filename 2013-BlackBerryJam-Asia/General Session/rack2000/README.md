# Råck 2000 #

Råck pronounced "Rock" is the game demoed at the BlackBerry Jam Asia 2013 keynote. 
The application is set up to have one host showing the game, to connect to the host
install the app on another device and connect to the game via NFC. By rocking the 
controller device back and forth (preferably by mounting it to a rocking chair) you 
control the game.
The host "game" device communicates with both controllers and a bluetooth connected 
Arduino (needs to be separately paired). The arduino code used for the setup can be found
in the rackcode folder.

Finally if you don't have an arduino setup and rocking chairs there is a test mode for 
the "game" device. Use the application menu to launch a game where you can explore the UI.

Rock on!
