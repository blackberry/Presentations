SlaveFlash
==========
The SlaveFlash sample illustrates how to:

* use an external flash in place of the on-device flash
* use continuous burst capture with a circular buffer to select a frame from the past to save
* compute a simple luminance histogram
* use review frames for reduced-resolution computation and correlate those results to the full-resolution frame
* display a photo viewfinder which may or may not be rotatable (sets appropriate window properties)
