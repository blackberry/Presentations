Weather History - Navigation

========================================================================
Sample Description.

 * Welcome to the history of weather. This application gives you the possibility
 * to view the weather in the past. As in all dealings with weather the accuracy
 * should always be subject for scrutiny. Remember the best way to get an accurate
 * weather data point is to look out a window and short of a window, call a friend.
 * The purpose of the sample app is to show how to handle large data sets that
 * are presented in a list and provided over a network. You will need to have a
 * weather server set up and running in order for the sample to work.
 *
 * You will learn:
 * - How to present data retrieved over a network in a list
 * - How to implement functionality for asking for more data when reaching the end of a list
 * - How to handler errors that can occur when talking to a server
