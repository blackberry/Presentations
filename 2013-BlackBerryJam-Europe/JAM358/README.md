Par Kjellberg, Daniel Rivera
Infinite scrolling in a listview relying on network data is not a task that should be 
taken lightly. There are all sorts of conditions to consider not to mention 
platform-specific constraints. Join us in this very practical session were we will explore 
the various options for implementing infinite scrolling with Cascades listviews.

Content of repo:
The weatherhistory app used to step by step show how to 
1 The basic list with an XML model
2 Data- QListModel in C++
3 Adding loaded data to the model
4 ListScrollStateHandler
5 Fetching more data and tracking index
6 Detecting more data available
7 The "loading" item
8 Error handling
9 Edge cases

Use the sample code to see how to handle networked data, you will have to connect it 
to you own server.
