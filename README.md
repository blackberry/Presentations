Presentations
=============

Material from BlackBerry's (previously known as Research in Motion) participation in Conferences,
Workshops, and similar events.

These samples are collateral material to that presented in the events.
The samples have been tested for the event but we make no guarantees that they will continue to work in later
releases.
The samples are not tracked in our [Sample Catalog](http://blackberry.github.com/samples).
