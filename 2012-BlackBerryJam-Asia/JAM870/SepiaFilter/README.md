SepiaFilter sample

This sample is written in C++ and uses the Native C Camera API and libscreen to implement a video recorder which uses read/write filter access to the camera buffers to implement a filter effect on the camera stream.
The sepia effect can be turned on or off. You could use this to apply any sort of colour filter.
