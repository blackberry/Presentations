# JAM833 Porting Apps

## Session
Apache Cordova

## Description
This is a do-it-yourself, hands-on, gritty session where we will assemble and use the tools for building a PhoneGap BlackBerryÂ® 10 application. There will sweat, grease, and digital sawdust across the stage, as members of the BlackBerry and PhoneGap team download, install, and setup the development environment. Once finished, the team will present a clean workbench of discrete tools for building, polishing, and refining your handcrafted BlackBerry 10 web application.

## Key-Takeaways
Learn how to install and setup the development environment to start developing on Apache Cordova and BlackBerry 10.
