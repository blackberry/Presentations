Moustacher
==========
The Moustacher sample draws a moustache on the largest face in the front-facing camera's field of view.
You can also record videos which include the moustache!

This samle illustrates how to:

* use event-mode interface to the viewfinder stream instead of callbacks
* access the viewfinder buffers read/write
* composite and scale a png buffer onto the screen (I use "composite" loosely, since it's only a luminance composite)
